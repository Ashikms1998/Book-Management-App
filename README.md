üîß Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or higher)

npm (usually comes with Node.js) 

A running instance of MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ashikms1998/Book-Management-App
cd Book-Management-App

2. Backend Setup
Navigate into the server directory and install the dependencies.

cd server
npm install

Create a .env file in the server directory and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your own.

MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://ashik:nQFrZtx3waZj8OFR@mern-auth2.8gyesqv.mongodb.net/oauth2?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=mern-auth2
PORT = 5000
JWT_SECRET = BooksManagementKey

To find your MONGO_URI, you can use MongoDB Atlas or follow local setup guides.

Start the backend server:

npm start

The backend will run on http://localhost:5000.

3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal, navigate into the client directory, and install dependencies.

cd ../client
npm install

Create a .env file in the client directory and set the URL for your backend API.

VITE_REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

For local development, this will be http://localhost:5000. When deploying, this should be your live backend URL (e.g., https://my-book-app-backend.onrender.com).

Start the frontend development server:

npm run dev

The frontend will open in your browser, typically at http://localhost:5173.
